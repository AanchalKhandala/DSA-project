This project focuses on implementing an "Undo" functionality using the stack data structure in JavaScript. The concept of "undo" is essential in various applications such as text editors, drawing tools, and content management systems, where the ability to revert to a previous state is crucial. By leveraging a stack, we can manage a series of user actions in a "last in, first out" (LIFO) manner, allowing efficient reversion of the most recent actions.

Key Features:

Stack Data Structure:
Actions performed by the user (e.g., typing, drawing, or any UI interaction) are pushed onto a stack.
Each action is stored as an object or a command, holding necessary information to restore or undo it.
Undo Operation:
The undo functionality is triggered by popping the most recent action from the stack.
Once popped, the previous state is restored or displayed.
Redo Capability (Optional):
A second stack can be used to handle redo operations by pushing undone actions onto it.
JavaScript Implementation:
Utilize core JavaScript data structures and event handling.
Efficient stack-based operations (push and pop) for managing actions.
User Interface:
Simple UI demonstrating the stack in action.
Buttons for "Undo" and "Redo" (if applicable).
Visual representation of states and stack content.
Applications:

Text Editors: Track and undo typing or formatting changes.
Drawing Tools: Manage strokes and revert to previous drawings.
Form Inputs: Restore previous field values in a form.
This project will provide a hands-on understanding of using stacks in practical scenarios and help build an understanding of state management using data structures in JavaScript.
